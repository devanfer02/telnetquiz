# Android Security & CVE Scanner

## Purpose

Perform a structured security audit of an Android project covering dependency CVEs, code-level vulnerabilities, manifest misconfigurations, and OWASP Mobile Top 10 issues. The output is a prioritized findings report with severity ratings and actionable fixes.

## Audit Workflow

Run each section below in order. For each finding, assign a severity: **CRITICAL**, **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, or **LOW**. Collect all findings into a final report at the end.

### 1. Dependency CVE Check

Scan `build.gradle.kts` (app and project level), `libs.versions.toml`, and any `buildSrc/` for declared dependencies. For each dependency:

1. Extract the group, artifact, and version
2. Search the web for known CVEs against that exact version using queries like `"<group>:<artifact>:<version>" CVE` or check the NVD/OSV databases
3. Flag any dependency that is significantly behind the latest stable release (major version behind = HIGH, minor = MEDIUM)
4. Pay special attention to networking libraries (OkHttp, Retrofit), serialization (Gson, Moshi, kotlinx.serialization), and image loading (Coil, Glide) — these are frequent CVE targets

**Common high-risk dependencies to check:**
- `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp` — TLS/HTTP vulnerabilities
- `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit` — deserialization issues
- `com.google.firebase:firebase-bom` — auth/storage misconfigurations
- `com.google.dagger:hilt-android` — code generation edge cases
- `io.coil-kt:coil-compose` — image parsing vulnerabilities
- Any WebView-related dependencies

### 2. AndroidManifest.xml Audit

Read `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and check:

- **Exported components**: Any `<activity>`, `<service>`, `<receiver>`, or `<provider>` with `android:exported="true"` (or implicitly exported via intent-filters on targetSdk < 31). Each exported component needs justification — flag unexplained exports as HIGH
- **Backup configuration**: `android:allowBackup="true"` without `android:fullBackupContent` restrictions exposes app data. Flag as MEDIUM
- **Debuggable**: `android:debuggable="true"` in release builds = CRITICAL
- **Cleartext traffic**: `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` = HIGH. Check for `network_security_config` reference
- **Permissions**: Flag dangerous permissions (`CAMERA`, `READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `RECORD_AUDIO`) — verify each is actually used in code. Unused dangerous permissions = MEDIUM
- **Deep links / intent filters**: Verify scheme handlers don't expose sensitive routes

### 3. Network Security

Search the codebase for network-related patterns:

- **Network Security Config**: Check `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`. Missing = MEDIUM. If present, check for `cleartextTrafficPermitted="true"` on any domain = HIGH
- **Certificate pinning**: Check OkHttp `CertificatePinner` usage. Absent for production API calls = MEDIUM (informational for educational apps)
- **TLS version**: Search for `SSLContext.getInstance` — anything below TLSv1.2 = HIGH
- **Custom TrustManagers**: Search for `X509TrustManager`, `TrustAllCerts`, `HostnameVerifier`. Custom trust managers that accept all certificates = CRITICAL
- **Hardcoded URLs**: Search for `http://` (not `https://`) in source code. Non-localhost HTTP = HIGH
- **API keys in source**: Search for `BuildConfig.API_KEY`, hardcoded API keys, or tokens in source files (not `BuildConfig`). Hardcoded secrets = CRITICAL. Keys loaded from `BuildConfig` but committed in `gradle.properties` or similar = HIGH

### 4. Data Storage Security

- **SharedPreferences / DataStore**: Search for `getSharedPreferences`, `dataStore`, `PreferencesDataStore`. Check if sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII) is stored without encryption. Use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` for sensitive data = MEDIUM if missing
- **Internal storage**: Search for `openFileOutput`, `MODE_WORLD_READABLE`, `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE`. World-readable/writable files = CRITICAL
- **External storage**: Search for `getExternalFilesDir`, `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory`. Sensitive data on external storage = HIGH
- **SQL injection**: Search for raw SQL queries with string concatenation. Use parameterized queries = HIGH
- **Room database**: Check for unencrypted databases storing sensitive data = MEDIUM
- **Logging sensitive data**: Search for `Log.d`, `Log.v`, `Log.i` that might log tokens, passwords, or PII = MEDIUM. Check if logging is disabled in release builds

### 5. WebView Security

Search for `WebView`, `WebViewClient`, `WebChromeClient`:

- **JavaScript enabled**: `settings.javaScriptEnabled = true` without input validation on loaded URLs = HIGH
- **File access**: `settings.allowFileAccess`, `settings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs`, `settings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` = HIGH if true
- **addJavascriptInterface**: On API < 17 this is exploitable. On modern APIs, verify `@JavascriptInterface` annotations are minimal and don't expose sensitive methods = MEDIUM
- **SSL error handling**: Overriding `onReceivedSslError` to call `handler.proceed()` = CRITICAL
- **Loading untrusted content**: WebView loading user-controlled URLs without validation = HIGH

### 6. Intent & IPC Security

- **Implicit intents with sensitive data**: Sending sensitive data via implicit intents that any app can intercept = HIGH
- **PendingIntent**: Search for `PendingIntent.getActivity`, `PendingIntent.getBroadcast`. Missing `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` on API 31+ = MEDIUM. Using `FLAG_MUTABLE` when immutable would work = LOW
- **Content providers**: Check `android:grantUriPermissions`, path permissions. Overly permissive URI grants = HIGH
- **Broadcast receivers**: Unprotected receivers without permission checks = MEDIUM

### 7. Cryptography

- **Weak algorithms**: Search for `MD5`, `SHA1` (for security purposes, not checksums), `DES`, `RC4`, `ECB` mode = HIGH
- **Hardcoded keys/IVs**: Search for `SecretKeySpec` with inline byte arrays, hardcoded IVs = CRITICAL
- **Insecure random**: `java.util.Random` for security-sensitive operations instead of `SecureRandom` = HIGH
- **KeyStore usage**: Check if cryptographic keys are stored in Android KeyStore. Keys stored in files or preferences = HIGH

### 8. Authentication & Session Management

- **Token storage**: Verify auth tokens are stored securely (EncryptedSharedPreferences, Android KeyStore, or EncryptedDataStore). Plain DataStore/SharedPreferences = MEDIUM
- **Token expiry**: Check if token refresh/expiry is handled. No expiry handling = LOW
- **Biometric auth**: If present, check `BiometricPrompt` implementation for proper `CryptoObject` usage
- **Root/emulator detection**: Note absence as informational (not a finding, but worth mentioning for high-security apps)

### 9. Build Configuration Security

- **ProGuard/R8**: Check if `isMinifyEnabled = true` in release builds. Disabled = MEDIUM (code is easily reverse-engineered)
- **Debug variants**: Verify debug-only code paths are gated behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`
- **Signing config**: Check for debug keystore usage in release builds = HIGH
- **API keys in VCS**: Check if `api.properties`, `local.properties`, `google-services.json` are in `.gitignore`. Committed secrets = CRITICAL

### 10. Compose-Specific Security

- **State exposure**: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) held in `remember { mutableStateOf() }` visible in layout inspector = LOW
- **Custom text fields**: Password fields should use `visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation()` and `keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Password)`
- **Screenshot prevention**: Sensitive screens should set `FLAG_SECURE` on the window if needed

## Tips

- Not every finding needs a fix — some are acceptable risks depending on the app's threat model. An educational quiz app has a different risk profile than a banking app. Note this in findings where relevant.
- Focus on real exploitable issues over theoretical concerns. A hardcoded API key that's already public (e.g., Firebase config) is different from a hardcoded secret key for encryption.
- When suggesting fixes, provide concrete code snippets, not just descriptions.
- If the project uses a code-review-graph, use `semantic_search_nodes_tool` and `query_graph_tool` to efficiently locate security-relevant code instead of scanning every file.
